### Project Description
RCG is a fun web app that uses AI to detect objects in your photos and generates quirky compliments for whatever it finds! Just upload any picture, and our app will spot the main object and serve up a lighthearted, personalized compliment‚Äîwhether it's your dog, your favorite mug, or even your shoes! Perfect for adding a smile to your day and making your snapshots feel appreciated. üòä

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world filled with serious photos and critical selfies, people are suffering from a severe lack of random, object-specific compliments. From underappreciated houseplants to uncelebrated coffee mugs, everyday objects are left feeling unloved and unnoticed. Humans, too, are missing out on the joy of hearing delightful and ridiculous praise for the most mundane items in their lives.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing RCG(Random Compliment Generator)‚Äîthe AI-powered compliment generator that brings appreciation to all things, big and small! Finally, your favorite chair, your half-eaten sandwich, or your loyal coffee mug can bask in the glory of a heartfelt (and sometimes absurd) compliment. Because why should only people get the love? Snap a photo, let the app do its magic, and give your objects the compliments they truly deserve!
